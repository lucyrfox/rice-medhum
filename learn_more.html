        <br>
        <p>In February of 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States.
            Seven months later, the United States has now counted well over 6 million cases with
            no end in sight. The virus devastated Northeastern states such as New York and New
            Jersey early in the pandemic. New York City itself has seen 239,000 cases with over
            23,000 deaths, while nearly 16,000 deaths have occured in New Jersey. In fact, New
            York and New Jersey have the highest death rates for COVID-19 in the United States.
            While the Northeast has thankfully moved past their peak, the virus has now taken
            over states such as California, Texas, and Florida, which have all surpassed New York
            and New Jersey’s case counts by far. Harris County, where Rice University is located,
            has had 106,000 cases to date.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>With researchers racing to create, test, and mass-produce an effective vaccine for the
            SARS-Cov-2 virus, healthcare workers still carry the burden of high case numbers. Not
            only have healthcare workers had to deal with more hectic schedules and a frustrating
            lack of protective gear, but they have also had to cope with the heavy psychological
            toll of this pandemic. In this sense, healthcare workers are combatting the virus along
            with their own exhaustion and distress. Several doctors and nurses are faced with the fear that they cannot
            do enough for their patients due to the absence of an effective vaccine. Healthcare professionals already
            have elevated levels of mental health issues such as depression and burnout, but the pandemic has
            exacerbated this problem. Houston Methodist’s employees have called its counseling center at a
            <a href="https://www.texastribune.org/2020/06/03/texas-coronavirus-health-workers-mental/">650%</a> higher
            rate. A recognized Emergency Room physician in New York City committed suicide due to the pandemic, even
            though she had
            <a
                href="https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/28/847305408/nyc-emergency-room-physician-who-treated-coronavirus-patients-dies-by-suicide">
                no prior history</a> of mental illness. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have even
            published a
            <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/mental-health-healthcare.html">webpage</a>
            as a resource healthcare workers can use to cope with their mental health during this
            pandemic.

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>As the current atmosphere surrounding the coronavirus centers on understanding the pathophysiology of the
            SARS-CoV-2 virus and discovering a vaccine, we feel a personal responsibility to highlight the psychosocial
            impacts of the virus. The Rice Medical Humanities Club wants to show gratitude to frontline workers and
            medical professionals by launching our “Notes for Coats” campaign, which encourages Rice students, faculty,
            and staff to write letters of support to healthcare workers across the country. We have partnered with
            multiple institutions including The Montefiore Health System of the Bronx, Tsehootsooi Medical Center of
            Arizona, and The Holy Name Medical Center in New Jersey. We hope that by sending these letters, healthcare
            professionals across the country feel appreciated and comforted during these difficult times.
